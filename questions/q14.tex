\noindent \textbf{Q14.} Prove Tutte's matching theorem: A graph \( G \) has a perfect matching if and only if \[ c_{o} (G - X) \leq |X| \] for every subset \( X \subseteq V(G) \).
\begin{proof}
Let's start with the ``only if" direction. Let \( M \) be a perfect matching in \( G \), and suppose there is a set \( X \subseteq V(G) \) with \( c_{o}(G - X) > |X|  \). Suppose \( C_1, C_2, \hdots , C_{k}  \) are the odd components of \( G - X \). Since \( M \) is perfect and each component is odd, for each \( j \in [k] \) there is a vertex \( v_{j} \in V(C_{j}) \) which is matched with a vertex \(x_{j} \notin C_{j}  \); hence \( x_{j} \in X \). But then two vertices \( v_{i_1} , v_{i_2}  \) must receive the same match in \( X \), a contradiction.

The ``if" direction is much harder. We proceed by induction on \( |V(G)| \). The theorem is trivial if \( |V(G)| \leq 2 \), so fix \( |V(G)| \geq 3 \) and suppose \( c_{o} (G - X) \leq |X| \) for every \( X \subseteq V(G) \). We prove a sequence of claims as follows:
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
	\item \textbf{Claim 1:}	\emph{\( |V(G)| \) is even.} It suffices to check that \( G \) has only even components. Set \( X = \emptyset  \). Then \( c_{o} (G - X) = c_{o} (G) \leq |\emptyset | = 0 \), so the claim holds.
	\item \textbf{Claim 2:} \emph{\( c_{o} (G - X) + |X| \) is always even.} If \( |X| \) is odd, then \( |V(G)| - |X| \) is too by claim 1, so \( G - X \) must have an odd number of components. The exact same reasoning shows that if \( |X| \) is even then so is \( c_{o} (G - X) \). Then, the claim holds since \( a + b \) is even if and only if \( a \) and \( b \) have the same parity.
	\item \textbf{Claim 3:} \emph{There is a subset \( X \subseteq V(G) \) such that \( c_{o} (G - X) = |X| \).} We will call such sets \( X \) \emph{critical}. If \( X = \emptyset  \) then \( c_{o} (G - X) = 0  \) as shown above, so \( \emptyset  \) is critical.
	\item \textbf{Claim 4:} \emph{Let \( Z \subseteq V(G) \) be critical with \( |Z| \) maximum. Then \( G - Z \) has no even components.} Suppose by contradiction that \( C \) is an even component of \( G - Z \), and fix \( x \in V(C) \). Then \( Z' = Z \cup \{ x \}  \) is critical so that \( Z \) is not maximal: \( c_{o} (G - Z') = c_{o} (G - Z) + 1 = |Z| + 1 = |Z'|  \), since deleting \( x \) from \( C \) will either give one odd component (if \( C - x \) is connected) or one even and one odd component.
	\item \textbf{Claim 5:} \emph{For each \( j \in [k] \), fix \( v_{j} \in V(C_{j}) \). Then \(C_{j}^{\ast} = C_{j} - v_{j}  \) has a perfect matching.} Suppose not. Then the IH implies that there is a set \( X \subseteq V(C^{\ast} _{j}) \) with \( c_{o} (C^{\ast} _{j} - X) > |X| \). But then \( Z' = Z \cup X \cup \{ v_{j}  \}  \) is critical:
		\begin{align*}
			c_{o} (G - Z') &= c_{o} (G - Z) - 1 + c_{o} (C^{\ast} _{j}  - X  ) \\
				       &> c_{o}(G - Z)  - 1 + |X| \\
				       &= |Z| - 1 + |X| = |Z'| - 2,
		\end{align*}
		so \( c_{o} (G - Z') \geq |Z'| - 1 \), but \( c_{o} (G - Z') \) and \( |Z'| \) have the same parity by claim 2, so we must have \( c_{o} (G - Z') \geq |Z'| \). By hypothesis, \( c_{o} (G - Z') \leq |Z'| \), so \( Z' \) is critical.
	\item \textbf{Claim 6:} \emph{\( G \) has a perfect matching.} Claim 5 shows that \( C^{\ast} _1, C^{\ast} _2, \hdots , C^{\ast} _{k}  \) have perfect matchings; so now we must match the points in \( Z \) with points in \(Y = \{ v_1, v_2, \hdots , v_{k}  \}  \). If there is no such (perfect) matching between \( Z \) and \( Y \), then Hall's theorem implies that there is a subset \( S \subseteq Y \) with \( |N(S)| < |S| \) (note that the induced graph is bipartite, deleting any edges \( z_{i} z_{j}  \)). Set \( X = N(S) \) and then note that \( c_{o} (G - X) \geq |S| > |N(S)| = |X| \) is a contradiction and the proof is done. \qedhere
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
\noindent \textbf{Q15.} Let \( G \) be a \( d \)-regular bipartite graph. Show that \( G \) has a perfect matching.
\begin{proof}
Suppose not. Let \( (A,B) \) be a bipartition of \( G \). Then Hall's theorem says that there is a set \( S \subseteq A \) with \( |N(S)| < |S| \). Note that there are \( d \cdot |S| \) edges leaving \( S \), and there are \( d \cdot |N(S) \) edges leaving \( N(S) \). But every edge leaving \( S \) has another end in \( N(S) \), so \( d \cdot |N(S)| < d \cdot |S| \) is a contradiction.
\end{proof}
\noindent \textbf{Q16.} Given \( n \in \mathbb{N}  \), determine the minimum \( \delta = \delta (n) \) such that every graph \( G \) on \( 2n \) vertices with minimum degree \( \delta  \) has a perfect matching.
\begin{proof}
First, we show that \( \delta = n \) suffices to guarantee a perfect matching in \( G \). We may assume that \( G \) is \( \delta  \)-regular, otherwise just delete any extra edges.

Given any graph \( G \), let \( (A_0,B_0) \) be any partition of \( V(G) \) such that \( |A_0| = |B_0| \). For any partition \( (A,B) \), let \( e(A) \) denote the number of edges with both ends in \( A \), and define \( e(B) \) analagously. We give an algorithm to obtain a bipartite subgraph of \( G \) which will contain a perfect matching.

Pick any \( a \in A_0 \) and \( b \in B_0 \). Define \( A_1 = A_0 \setminus \{ a \} \cup \{ b \}  \) and \( B_1 = B_0 \setminus \{ b \} \cup \{ a \}  \). If \( e(A_0) + e(B_0) > e(A_1) + e(B_1) \), then repeat the algorithm again with the partition \( (A_1, B_1) \), otherwise try again with any other pair of vertices. Since \( G \) is finite, this process terminates with a partition \( (A,B) \) of \( V(G) \) which minimises the number of edges with both ends in \( A \) or both ends in \( B \). Then, it follows that each \( a \in A \) has at least \( \lceil n / 2 \rceil \) neighbours in \( B \) and each \( b \in B \) has at least \( \lceil n / 2 \rceil \) neighbours in \( A \). Let \( H \) be obtained from \( G \) by deleting all edges with both ends in either \( A \) or \( B \). Then \( H \) is \( \lceil n/2 \rceil \)-regular and bipartite, and so by Q15 it has a perfect matching. Thus, \( G \) does too.

We complete the proof by showing that \( \delta = n - 1 \) does not suffice to guarantee a perfect matching. Consider the complete bipartite graph \( K_{n-1, n+1}  \). Deleting the smaller partite set of \( n - 1 \) vertices results in \( n + 1 \) isolated vertices, which violates Tutte's condition. Hence, \( K_{n-1, n+1}  \) has no perfect matching. Note that \( \delta (K_{n-1, n+2}) = n - 1 \).
\end{proof}
\noindent \textbf{Q17.} Show that for every bridgeless cubic graph \( G \) and every \( e \in E(G) \) there is a perfect matching in \( G \) containing \( e \).
\begin{proof}
Fix any edge \( uv \in E(G) \) and let \( e,f \in E(G) \) be the other two edges incident to \( v \). Let \( G' \) be obtained from \( G \) by deleting the edges \( e,f \). To show that \( G \) has a perfect matching containing \( uv \), it suffices to prove that \( G' \) has a perfect matching. Hence, we use Tutte's theorem to show that \( c_{o} (G' - X) \leq |X| \) for every subset \( X \subseteq V(G') \).

Suppose for a contradiction that there is a set \( X \subseteq V(G) \) such that \( c_{o} (G' - X) > |X| \). Note that \( c_{o} (G' - X) \) and \( |X| \) have the same parity since \( |V(G')| \) is even, hence \( c_{o} (G' - X) \geq |X| + 2 \). Let \( C_1, C_2, \hdots , C_{n}  \) denote the odd components of \( G' - X \). For each \( j \in [n] \), let \( \ell_{j}  \) be the number of edges in \( G \) leaving \( C_{j}  \). Then since \( G \) is cubic, \[ \sum_{v \in V(C_{j})}^{} \deg_{G} v = 2 |E(C_{j})| + \ell_{j} = 3 |V(C_{j})|. \] Observe that LHS is even (since \( |V(C_{j})| \) is odd), hence \( \ell_{j} \) must be odd. Furthermore, \( \ell_{j} \geq 2 \) since \( G \) is bridgeless, and since \( \ell_{j}  \) is odd we have \( \ell_{j} \geq 3 \). Let \( r_{j} \) be the number of edges in \( G \) with one end in \( C_{j}  \) and the other in another odd component \( C_{i}  \), and let \( q_{j} = \ell_{j} - r_{j}  \) be the remaining edges. Then \( \sum_{j=1}^{n} r_{j} \leq 4 \) since we only deleted two edges, and since \( G \) is 3-regular, \( \sum_{j=1}^{n} q_{j} \leq 3|X|  \). 

Then, putting everything together,
\begin{align*}
	c_{o} (G' - X) &= n \leq \frac{1}{3} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \ell_{j} = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{j=1}^{n} (q_{j} + r_{j}) \\
	 &\leq \frac{1}{3}\sum_{j=1}^{n} q_{j} + 4/3 \leq |X| + 4/3
\end{align*}
But recall that \( c_{o} (G' - X) = n \geq |X| + 2\), so we may rearrange the above to obtain \( |X| + 2 - 2/3 \geq n \) and hence \( n - 2/3 \geq n \) is a contradiction. Therefore, \( G' \) has a perfect matching. Since \( v \) has degree one in \( G' \), it follows that \( G \) has a perfect matching containing \( uv \). 
\end{proof}
